# Step 4: Begin creating your first shape!

There are many different shapes you can choose from, but lets start off creating a circle. Copy the code in the image below.

Lets break down the different parts of the script. 

`<svg width="100" height="100">`

This part of the code tells the computer what size to create the image at. Since vector images are two dimensional, we only need to tell the computer the **width** and **height** of the object.

---
`<circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" stroke="blue" stroke-width="4" fill="pink" />`

This is the next part, where we tell the computer the specifics of the code. ***circle** tells the computer that we want to create a circle. 
**cx** and **cy** relate to the x and y axis of the page the image will reside on.
**stroke** relates to the color the border of the circle will be, and **stroke width** tells the computer how thick the border will be.
Lastly, **fill** is the space within the borders of the circle.

All of these categories are able to be changed to any number or color. Try playing around with it!
