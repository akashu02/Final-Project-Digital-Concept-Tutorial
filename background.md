# What are Scalable Vector Graphics?

Scalable vector graphics, or **SVGs**, are an extensible markup language (XML) based vector image format. Its main purpose is to describe two dimensional graphics with an easy to script syntax. SVG images are defined in vector graphics format and the information is stored in XML text files. This allows for image scaling without the quallity of the image dropping.

There are three types of objects that can be created using SVGs: vector graphic shapes, bitmap images, and text. Aside from simply scripting the objects, there is a number of different ways to change their appearance. Some of these alterations are transformations, clipping paths, alpha masks, filter effects, and template objects. In some more advanced iterations, SVGs can be interactive with the user, and can be animated using scripting that can access the document object module (DOM).
